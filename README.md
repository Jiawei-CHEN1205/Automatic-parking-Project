# Automatic-parking-Project
Based on ROS + OpenCV + Ubuntu16.04, using a mobile robot named Dashgo.
Identified a parking sign "H" using color segmentation and canny edge detection with OpenCV.
Built a feedback control loop to control the angular and linear velocities of an autonomous car using the location and the size of the parking sign.
Integrated the sign detection module and the control module in ROS and successfully implemented fully automated parking.
Notice: pay attention to the camera name 0/1, a real-time watch window may be necessary to checkout the camera choice (PC/Robot).
